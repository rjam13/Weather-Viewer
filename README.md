# Weather-Viewer
A simple app that displays a table view of a few images of various storms created using Swift and XCode.

This app was mainly created to understand and get a sense of iOS Development. Here, I learned how to 

use the file manager, 
save data using UserDefaults and JSONDecoder/JSONEncoder,
and manipulate main.storyboard to create connections between interface builder and the code itself.
